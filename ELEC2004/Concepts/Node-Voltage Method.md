Procedure.
1. Label all circuit parameters - identify the unknown parameters (voltages and currents)
2. Identify all *essential* nodes
3. Select a node as the reference node (ground). Assign it with a potential of 0 volts. All other voltages are measure with respect to the reference node.
4. Label the voltages at all other nodes
5. Apply KCL at each node and express currents in terms of node voltages.
6. Solve the resulting equations for node voltages.

-  Identify nodes: **a, b and ground.**
- Express voltages across branches with voltages of the nodes connected by the branch.
