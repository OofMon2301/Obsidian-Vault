Procedure
1. Label all circuit parameters and identify unknown parameters (voltages and currents)
2. Identify all meshes of the circuit
3. Assign mesh currents and label polarities
4. Apply KVL at each mesh and express voltages in terms of the mesh currents.
5. Solve the resulting simultaneous equations for the mesh currents
6. Now that the mesh currents are known, the voltages may be obtained from Ohm's Law.
