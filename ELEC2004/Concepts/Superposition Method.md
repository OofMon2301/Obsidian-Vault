Applies to all linear systems
- Means that each source in a circuit can be treated independently
- The complete response of a circuit calculated by adding the impact of each independent source
-  One Active Source. Set all other sources to zero.
	- Replace the current source with an open circuit (0 Amps Flowing)
	- Replace the voltage source with a short circuit (0 Volts across the source)
- Calculate the voltage/current at the point of interest
- Repeat for each source in the circuit
