Big-O notation describes an *upper bound* on a function

$f(n)$ is $O(g(n))$ if $f(n)$ is asymptotically less than or equal to $g(n)$

Given functions $f(n)$ and $g(n)$, we can say that $f(n)$ is $O(g(n))$ if there are positive constants $c$ and $n_{0}$ such that
$$
f(n) \leq c \cdot g(n) \quad \text{for } n \geq n_{0}
$$
